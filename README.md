# Airflow-analysis
Airflow analysis in a ceiling fan system.
# Pressure and subsequent velocity data collection/analysis in an enclosed room with a system of ceiling fans. 
# 3-D printed set of pitot tubes were calibrated experimentally in the wind tunnel first, 
# following which a portable setup was fabricated for the pitot tubes to collect data. 
# Aimed at optimizing ceiling fan positions for optimal airflow inside a room.
