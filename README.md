# Airflow-Analysis

This intra-university project deals with airflow analysis in a ceiling fan system. Was done as an undergraduate project.
Pressure and subsequent velocity data collection/analysis done in an enclosed room with a system of ceiling fans. 
A 3-D printed set of pitot tubes were calibrated experimentally in the wind tunnel first,
following which a portable setup was fabricated for the pitot tubes to collect data. The data was subsequently analyzed and  
The project was aimed at optimizing ceiling fan positions for optimal airflow inside an enclosed room.
