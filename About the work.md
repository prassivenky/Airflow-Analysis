# Airflow-analysis
This intra-university project deals with airflow analysis in a ceiling fan system. Was done as an undergraduate project.
Pressure and subsequent velocity data collection/analysis done in an enclosed room with a system of ceiling fans. 
3-D printed set of pitot tubes were calibrated experimentally in the wind tunnel first,
following which a portable setup was fabricated for the pitot tubes to collect data. 
Aimed at optimizing ceiling fan positions for optimal airflow inside a room.
